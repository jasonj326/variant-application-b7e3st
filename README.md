Jason Lai: A Guide to Working with Me

"Most counsel look for reasons to say 'no.' I measure success by shipping product."

This is a living document intended to serve as a "user manual" for working with me. It’s inspired by the transparent culture of open-source communities. My goal here is to accelerate our working relationship by being upfront about my communication style, my professional philosophy, my quirks, and my values.

🎯 My Role (As I See It)

As a Legal Strategist & Builder, my core function is to transform regulatory fog into deployment velocity. In the fast-paced worlds of Web3 and AI, "legal" must move at the speed of product.

I don't view legal as a back-office compliance checkpoint; I view it as a strategic growth lever. I am here to help founders and investment teams navigate gray zones so they can outmaneuver incumbents safely.

🧠 Professional Philosophy

Builder-First: Having transitioned across a Paralegal/Government/Head of Legal to a Fractional GC, I care about your product roadmap just as much as the compliance matrix.

Clarity and Brevity: I strongly believe in "Smart Brevity." If I am handing an investment committee or a founder a 20-page memo, I have failed. I distill complex risk into actionable decision logs, trackers, and go/no-go inputs.

Embrace the Gray: Perfect regulatory clarity does not exist in crypto or any emerging tech areas. My job is to underwrite the risk based on reason and human emotions and behaviors, provide Best/Base/Worst case scenarios, and give you the confidence to ship.

💬 Communication Preferences

Async vs. Sync: The Right Tool for the Job
Async (Deep Work): For legal and regulatory analysis, share your thoughts and questions, along with facts and scenarios. This removes timezone limits and allows for "second thoughts" and creative reflection.
Sync (Firefighter Mode): For quick gut-checks, DM me on Telegram/Signal. This is for sprinting through urgent issues in real-time.

Response Times: I generally reply to messages within 12 hours. If it's a true emergency, call me.


Note: This README is a living document. As I learn, grow, and adapt, this guide will evolve alongside me.
